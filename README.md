master chef reciepe for pav bhaji
If you do not have access to these, here is my quick recipe to make your own homemade Pav Bhaji Masala: 

4 tablespoons coriander seeds
1 tablespoon cumin seeds
1 tablespoon fennel seeds
6 Kashmiri red chilies, less if using a spicier variety
2-inch cinnamon stick
6 cloves
4 green cardamom
1 teaspoon black peppercorns
Dry roast all of the above spices on medium heat. Allow the spices to cool down. Add the roasted spices along with 2 teaspoons of amchur {dry raw mango} powder to a spice grinder and make a fine powder, Store in an airtight container.

Here are other substitutions to pav bhaji masala in a pinch - Add 1 to 2 teaspoons of homemade garam masala, 1 tablespoon of ground coriander, 1 tablespoon red chili powder, and 1 to 2 teaspoons amchur or dry mango powder.
